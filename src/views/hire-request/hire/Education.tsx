            With Next.js, your React applications start with a rich structure and set of features. Built-in routing,
            server-side rendering, and among numerous other features, Next.js is a powerful framework built upon React
            to create production-ready applications. On top of that, Next.js also offers first-class support for
            TypeScript. This means that you can easily start building efficient React applications with all of the
            advantages of a strongly-typed language like TypeScript.
